#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) -- there is only 1 comparison being performed 


b) O(n^2) -- there are 3 operations/comparisons being performed on j 


c) O(n) -- the algorithm is recursive but is only performing 1 action and then reducing the input 

## Exercise II

We could find the middle floor of the building and test that, if the egg doesnt break find the middle floor of the top half of the building and repeat untill the floor is found. If the egg does break do the same with the bottom half.

this is a bianary search so the complexity is O(log n)
